- Verbose and quick test modes
- Integration with pytest

### 4. ✅ Add Comprehensive Test Cases (High Priority)
- 14 comprehensive test files covering all features
- Expected output verification
- Automated test execution and validation
- Test documentation and status tracking

### 5. ✅ Improve Error Messages and Add Error Recovery (Medium Priority)
- Professional error reporting with:
  - File location (line:column)
  - Color-coded severity levels
  - Helpful hints for common errors
  - Basic error recovery for missing semicolons
- Structured error management system

### 6. ✅ Add Compiler Warnings (Medium Priority)
- Semantic analysis phase

2. Standard library integration
3. Complete global variable support
4. Missing operators (bitwise, compound assignment)
5. Full variadic function support

## Conclusion

The CCC compiler has evolved from a simple educational project into a sophisticated compiler with professional features. It serves as an excellent foundation for:
- Learning compiler construction
- Understanding optimization techniques
- Exploring language implementation
- Working toward self-hosting capability

All initially planned tasks have been completed successfully, with many exceeding original expectations in terms of quality and functionality.
