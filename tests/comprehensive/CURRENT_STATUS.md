# Comprehensive Test Suite - Current Status

This document tracks the current status of comprehensive test cases and identifies compiler limitations discovered during testing.

## Test Infrastructure

✅ **Completed**
- Comprehensive test runner (`run_comprehensive_tests.py`)
- Test file template with expected output format
- Documentation and usage guidelines
- Integration with main test runner

## Test Cases Created

### ✅ Framework Tests (Basic Structure)
- `test_working_arithmetic.c` - Simple arithmetic that compiles
- Template structure for comprehensive tests

### 🚧 Comprehensive Test Files (Need Updates)
These test files have been created but need to be updated to work with current compiler limitations:

1. `test_basic_arithmetic.c` - ❌ Uses unsupported operators (`%`)
2. `test_control_flow.c` - ❌ Uses C-style comments
3. `test_arrays_pointers.c` - ❌ Uses C-style comments
4. `test_functions.c` - ❌ Uses C-style comments
5. `test_structures.c` - ❌ Uses C-style comments
6. `test_operators.c` - ❌ Uses C-style comments
7. `test_function_pointers.c` - ❌ Uses C-style comments
8. `test_static_variables.c` - ❌ Uses C-style comments
9. `test_enums_typedefs.c` - ❌ Uses C-style comments
10. `test_strings_chars.c` - ❌ Uses C-style comments
11. `test_variadic_functions.c` - ❌ Uses C-style comments
12. `test_const_qualifiers.c` - ❌ Uses C-style comments
13. `test_type_casting.c` - ❌ Uses C-style comments
14. `test_sizeof_operator.c` - ❌ Uses C-style comments

## Compiler Limitations Discovered

### Lexer Issues
- ❌ **C-style comments not supported**: `/* comment */` causes parse errors
- ❌ **Modulo operator not implemented**: `%` operator not recognized
- ✅ **C++ style comments work**: `// comment` works fine

### Parser Issues
- ❌ **Function pointer return types**: Complex function pointer syntax may not parse
- ❌ **Complex struct initializers**: May have issues with advanced initialization
- ❌ **Variadic function calls**: Syntax works but runtime behavior needs testing

### Semantic Analysis Issues
- ⚠️ **Type consistency**: Some type mismatches in array code generation
- ⚠️ **Const enforcement**: Const qualifier parsing vs enforcement

### Code Generation Issues
- ⚠️ **Array type consistency**: Inconsistent LLVM types for arrays
- ⚠️ **Static variable initialization**: Complex static initializers may fail

## Immediate Actions Needed

### High Priority
1. **Convert all test files to use `//` comments instead of `/* */`**
2. **Remove or replace modulo operator usage**
3. **Test and fix basic arithmetic operations**
4. **Verify function pointer syntax works**

### Medium Priority
1. **Update test expectations based on actual compiler behavior**
2. **Add error test cases for unsupported features**
3. **Create simplified versions of complex tests**

### Low Priority
1. **Add comprehensive integration tests**
2. **Performance benchmarking tests**
3. **Stress tests with large programs**

## Test Categories Prioritization

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality ✅
- Simple arithmetic (without modulo)
- Basic control flow
- Simple function calls
- Variable declarations

### Phase 2: Core Features 🚧
- Arrays and pointers (fix type issues)
- Structures and unions
- Function pointers (verify syntax)
- String and character handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features 📋
- Static variables
- Enums and typedefs
- Type casting
- Const qualifiers
- Variadic functions
- Sizeof operator

## Expected Test Results (When Fixed)

Once the test files are updated to work with current compiler capabilities:

### Working Features (Should Pass)
- Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Variable declarations and assignments
- Function definitions and calls
- Simple control flow: `if`/`else`, `while`, `for`
- Array indexing (basic)
- Pointer operations (basic)
- Return statements

### Partially Working Features (May Need Adjustment)
- Function pointers (syntax may work, complex cases might not)
- Structures (basic operations should work)
- Static variables (basic cases should work)
- Type casting (simple cases should work)

### Known Limitations (Expected to Fail)
- Modulo operator (`%`)
- C-style comments (`/* */`)
- Complex initialization expressions
- Advanced pointer arithmetic
- Variadic function runtime behavior (syntax only)

## Testing Strategy

### Immediate Approach
1. Create minimal working versions of each test
2. Focus on positive test cases (features that should work)
3. Document expected failures clearly
4. Build comprehensive coverage incrementally

### Future Approach
1. Add negative test cases (features that should fail gracefully)
2. Add boundary condition tests
3. Add integration tests combining multiple features
4. Add performance and stress tests

## Integration with Main Test Runner

The comprehensive test suite integrates with the main test runner:

```bash
# Run all comprehensive tests
python3 tests/run_tests.py --category comprehensive

# Run comprehensive tests directly
cd tests/comprehensive
python3 run_comprehensive_tests.py
```

## Maintenance

This status document should be updated as:
- Tests are fixed and verified to work
- New compiler limitations are discovered
- New test cases are added
- Compiler issues are resolved
