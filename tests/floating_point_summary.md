# Floating Point Support Implementation

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Lexer Support
- Added `TOKEN_KEYWORD_FLOAT` and `TOKEN_KEYWORD_DOUBLE` for type keywords
- Added `TOKEN_FLOAT_LITERAL` for floating point constants
- Enhanced `lexer_read_number()` to parse:
  - Decimal numbers (3.14)
  - Scientific notation (1.23e-4)
  - Float suffix (3.14f)
- Updated Token union to store `double float_value`

### 2. Parser Support
- Added `AST_FLOAT_LITERAL` node type
- Updated AST union to include `float_literal` with `double value`
- Modified `parse_primary()` to handle float literals (including negative)
- Updated `parse_type()` to recognize float and double types
- Added float literal support to `ast_print()` and `ast_clone()`

### 3. Code Generator Support
- Added basic float literal code generation using LLVM IR
- Generates `fadd double 0.0, %f` for float constants

## What Still Needs Implementation

### 1. Type System
- Update symbol table to track float/double types
- Add type size calculations (float=4, double=8 bytes)
- Implement type checking for float operations

### 2. Operations
- Binary operations: +, -, *, / for floats (fadd, fsub, fmul, fdiv)
- Comparison operations: <, >, <=, >= for floats (fcmp)
- Type conversions: int-to-float (sitofp), float-to-int (fptosi)
- Mixed arithmetic (int + float â†’ float)

### 3. Function Support
- Float/double parameters and return types
- Calling convention adjustments for floating point

### 4. Memory Operations
- Load/store for float types
- Array support for float/double

### 5. Standard Library
- Math functions (sin, cos, sqrt, etc.)
- Printf support for %f format specifier

### 6. Optimizer
- Constant folding for float operations
- Float-specific optimizations

## Example Test Case

The test file `test_float.c` demonstrates various floating point features:
- Basic float and double declarations
- Arithmetic operations
- Scientific notation
- Float suffixes

## Current Status

The foundation for floating point support has been laid with lexer and parser changes. However, full support would require significant changes throughout the compiler, particularly in type checking and code generation. This provides a solid starting point for future enhancement.
