# Compiler Warnings Implementation Summary

The CCC compiler now includes a semantic analysis phase that generates helpful warnings to improve code quality.

## Implemented Warnings

### 1. Unused Variables
- Detects local variables that are declared but never referenced
- Helps identify dead code and reduce memory usage
- Example:
  ```c
  int unused = 10;  // Warning: unused variable 'unused'
  ```

### 2. Infrastructure for Additional Warnings
The framework supports these warning types (with partial implementation):
- **Uninitialized Variables**: Warns when a variable is used before being assigned
- **Unreachable Code**: Detects code after return/break/continue statements  
- **Missing Return**: Warns when non-void functions may not return a value
- **Implicit Conversions**: Warns about potentially lossy type conversions

## Implementation Details

### Architecture
1. **Semantic Analyzer** (`semantic.h/semantic.c`)
   - Performs a post-parsing AST traversal
   - Maintains scope-aware symbol tracking
   - Generates warnings without stopping compilation

2. **Enhanced Symbol Table**
   - Added `is_used` and `is_initialized` flags to track variable state
   - Records declaration location for accurate error reporting

3. **Warning System**
   - Integrated with the error reporting infrastructure
   - Uses severity levels (warning vs error)
   - Provides helpful hints for fixing issues
   - Color-coded output (yellow for warnings)

### Example Output
```
tests/example.c:5:9: warning: unused variable 'unused'
  hint: Remove the unused variable or use it

: 1 warning generated
```

## Usage
Warnings are automatically generated during compilation. They do not prevent successful compilation unless there are also errors.

## Future Enhancements
1. Control flow analysis for more accurate "missing return" detection
2. Data flow analysis for better uninitialized variable tracking
3. Warning flags (-Wall, -Wunused, etc.) to control which warnings are enabled
4. More warning types: shadow variables, unreachable code, etc.
